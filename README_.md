# Sentinel

[![Build Status][travis-svg]][travis-url]

Docker image for Sentinel.
This is the catchphrase: what does this project do and how is it unique?
Here is an additional quick introduction, if necessary.

## Why?

Why does this project exist? Come on, don't delete this part. Fill it.
Yes it's hard, but it's perhaps the most important part of the README.

As to why *this* project exist, it's to serve as a template for future open
source PHP projects. Of course, feel free to fork it and make your own recipe.

## Installation

Describe how to install the project/library/framework/…

Make sure your installation instructions work by testing them!

## Usage

Describe how to use the project. A gif or a short code example is the best
way to show how it works. Also keep paragraphs short and sentences simple: not
everybody speaks english well.

For the sake of the example here is how you can use this project template
as a basis for your own repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lepetitbloc/repository-template.git my-project
cd my-project
# Remove the git repository metadata
rm -rf .git/
# Start a brand new repository
git init
git add .
```

Easy peasy! Now you just have to code.

Make sure your examples work by testing them! I didn't test mine and I should feel ashamed.
